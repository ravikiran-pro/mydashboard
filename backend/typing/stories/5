"I am sorry, my dear. The sea is very rough
today. I hope my men can reach him in time. My
ship has never lost a passenger before," he said
crossing himself. He was watching the rescue
operations through a pair of binoculars that hung
round his neck.
The boat was too far for me to see what was
happening. I tugged at the Captain's sleeve.
"What are they doing, Sir? Have they rescued
the man?" I asked him.
"They've caught him by the arms and are pulling him towards the boat." He was giving me a
running commentary. "Oh what bad luck! A sudden current has swept the man away dragging
two of the sailors with him." He sounded nervous.
Just then he noticed the passengers crowding
against the railings. "Keep away from those railings!" he shouted. "We don't want another
accident." The ship had dropped anchor but was
heaving up and down.
