Man overboard! Save him!" I must have made a
lot of noise. I heard footsteps hurrying even that
early in the morning.
Tears streaming down my face and shouting
incoherently, I ran full pelt into an officer.
"What's the matter? Why are you making so
much noise?" he asked in a stern voice, I was
surprised to see it was the captain.
"Oh Sir!" I blurted out in relief. "A man fell
into the sea. Please save him."
"Where?" he asked, immediately on the alert.
"There," I said pointing a finger.
He did not wait for more details but ran at
once to a room full of officers. "Man overboard,"
he cried. "Stop ship. Drop anchor. Quick!" His
instructions were immediately obeyed. The captain then raced to the upper deck. I kept trailing
behind him. "Lower the life-boats and crew into
the sea towards the helm," he said. "There is a
man overboard." Here again the men quickly
obeyed him.
