"Oh! my Sivnha has come!" exclaimed Shivaji.
He embraced Tanaji and said, "Come, sit down.
We have a difficult assignment. Ma Sahib* feels
that the other forts are not safe so long as we
do not recapture Kondana fort.
"Udai Singh Rathor is in command of the
Mughal forces. His men are guarding the three
gates. His sons are also with him. All of them are
brave fighters. There is also the killer elephant
Chandrawati. She is a force by herself. I have
thought and thought, but can't find a way of capturing the fort. You are the only one who may
be able to find a way."
The lines deepened on Tanaji's brow. Then
he spoke. "I have a plan. The fort is guarded only
on three sides. We will try to enter from the west."
"What?" Shivaji sprang up. "Enter from the
west? You're not planning to climb that precipice?
It is unassailable."
Tanaji said coolly â€” "No, Raje, it is not the
way I intend doing it." He then explained his plan
to Shivaji in detail.
