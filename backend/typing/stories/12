"He has not accepted the medicine. I'm sure his
throat is swollen and clogged." He took a piece
of paper and wrote down the names of some medicines. "Here my Lord! I can only prescribe these
potions for the patient. Kindly try them. Howal
shaft'â€¢!* May God cure him," said the Hakim.
He handed the slip to the Emperor and left
the palace in dismay.
Babar passed the prescription on to the Chief
Vizier. Meanwhile, one of the court priests had
entered the chamber. He bowed low and said,
"My Lord! Kindly offer to God whatever you love
most. I am sure God will be kind enough to give
Humayun a new lease of life."
"Should I renounce my wealth and my kingdom?" asked Babar.
"That's up to you, my Lord. You should offer
what you love most," the priest replied.
"What do I love most?" the Emperor muttered.
"Only you can answer that my Lord."
"Dearest to my heart is Humayun," Babar
replied.
