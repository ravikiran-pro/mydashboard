I spent the day exploring the ship. It looked
just like a big house. There were furnished rooms,
a swimming pool, a room for indoor games, and
a library. Yet, there was plenty of room to 11111
around.
The next morning the passengers were seated
in the dining hall, having breakfast. The loudspeaker spluttered noisily and then the captain's
voice came loud and clear. "Friends we have just
received a message that a storm is brewing in the
Indian Ocean. I request all of you to keep calm.
Do not panic. Those who are inclined sickness may please stay in their cabins. TThank you."
There was panic everywhere. An old lady prayed aloud, "Oh God! Have mercy on us. My only
son is waiting for me in Singapore."
A gentleman consoled her, "Don't worry,
Madam, it's only a warning. We may not be
affected at all."
