This made my imagination run wild. Turning
to 'Uncle' again, I said, "Wouldn't it be fun if the
storm broke when we have lunch? Then the
tables, with all the food on them, would run away
from us. And the chairs, with us sitting on them,
would be a merry-go-round."
Everyone round the table stared at me in horror. I thought to myself, 'Oh, these adults, they've
no sense of adventure. How dull they are!'
The storm didn't break, but in the evening a
strong wind started blowing. The ship rocked to
and fro, rocking and rolling to the music of the
wind. Huge waves were dashing against it. Even
though the deck was slippery, I was running
around. That's when I noticed Uncle leaning over
the railings. I ran up to him, thinking he too,
was enjoying the experience. "Good morning,
Uncle, isn't it lovely?" I asked him.
