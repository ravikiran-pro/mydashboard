Tanaji Malusare was Shivaji's childhood friend
and companion at arms. He was very brave and
daring. Shivaji proudly called him his Sivnha or
Lion. Tanaji had planned and fought many a battle by the side of his leader. They were determined to free their land from Mughal domination.
Tanaji lived in the small town of Umratha. One
morning, Umratha wore a festive look. Colourful
bunting fluttered in the streets. There was a
Mangal Kolas* at every door. Tanaji's son was
to be married that day. People went in and out
of his house, busy running errands.
Just then a messenger came galloping down the
street. "Look!" cried a man who had noticed him
in the distance. "What news can he be bringing?"
he asked Tanaji's servant who was near him. Before the servant could reply, the rider came to a
stop in front of them. He leapt off his horse and
said, "Where is Tanaji? I must see him at once."
"In the house Sir," answered the servant. He
had recognised the rider. "I'll take you to him."
