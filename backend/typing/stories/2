I could not understand why all the elders were
so upset. I remembered the several sea adventures I had read. Excitedly, I turned to the elderly gentleman sitting next to me. "Uncle, won't it
be thrilling to face a storm on board a steamer?
Have you ever been on a ship during a storm?"
"It can be quite unpleasant, you know," he replied rather severely. "I remember a time when
the ship on which I was travelling ran off course.
We were wandering on the ocean for a couple of
days."
I remembered my class teacher, an English woman, telling us in class one day, "When I crossed
the English Channel on my way to Singapore,
there was a big storm near Gibraltar. The ship
rocked to and fro. Everything in the cabins rolled up and down. Even the heavy pianos in the
lounge went crashing against the walls."
